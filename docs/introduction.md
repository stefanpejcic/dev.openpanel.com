# Welcome

Welcome to the Development section of OpenPanel, where developers can dive into extending the capabilities of our platform. OpenPanel is designed with flexibility in mind, allowing you to enhance its functionality and tailor it to your specific needs.

Before starting with custom development, please first get familiar with our user docs:

Afterwards, make sure to understand OpenPanel directory structure, services and logs:

# Updates  

OpenPanel adheres to **Semantic Versioning** with a format of **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** (e.g., `0.6.5`). Each part of the version indicates:  
- **MAJOR**: Backward-incompatible changes.  
- **MINOR**: New backward-compatible functionality.  
- **PATCH**: Backward-compatible bug fixes.  

### Release Schedule  
OpenPanel updates are released at least once a month, except for urgent bug fixes or critical security patches. 

The [OpenPanel Roadmap](https://openpanel.com/roadmap) provides an overview of planned features and anticipated release dates for upcoming versions.

### Update Availability  
Updates for existing installations are made available **one week after a new version is released**. This delay ensures that new versions are thoroughly tested in production environments before being rolled out to existing users. During this period, the latest version is available only for new installations.  

### Installing Beta Updates  
If you wish to update before the scheduled release, you can manually apply the update by downloading the [update scripts from GitHub](https://github.com/stefanpejcic/OpenPanel/tree/main/version).

# OpenPanel Modules

## Introduction

OpenPanel utilizes modules, which are separate Python files that **cannot** be executed directly but only through the OpenPanel interface. These modules enrich the OpenPanel interface by introducing new pages or sections to the current template.

Modules are intended for adding functionality rather than just aesthetic modifications. For visual changes, please utilize [templates](/templates/) instead.

Modules offer additional features that administrators can enable or disable. Disabling a module immediately removes its associated menu item, search functionality, and page visibility.

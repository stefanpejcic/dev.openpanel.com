## Notifications

`opencli admin notifications` allows you to change the notification preferences.

Settings are stored in `/etc/openpanel/openadmin/config/notifications.ini` file. However, it is recommended not to modify this file directly. Instead, it's best to utilize the opencli commands. This way, any changes made are immediately applied, and the admin service is automatically restarted only when necessary.

#### Get

The `get` parameter allows you to view current notification settings.

```bash
opencli admin notifications get <OPTION>
```

Example:

```bash
# opencli admin notifications get reboot
yes
```

#### Update

The `update` parameter allows you to change the notification settings.


```bash
opencli admin notifications update <OPTION> <NEW-VALUE>
```

Example:
```bash
opencli admin notifications update load 10
Updated load to 10
```

- reboot
- backups
- attack

# OpenCLI
OpenPanel uses OpenCLI, a command line interface designed for administrators to manage server from the terminal.

OpenCLI keeps history of used commands and allows you to view last and top 5 used commands:
```bash
# opencli

Usage: opencli <COMMAND> [additional_arguments]

Suggested commands:
  opencli faq                       Display frequently asked questions and answers.

  opencli user-add

Most commonly used commands:
  opencli admin

```

The autocomplete functionality enhances user experience by displaying available OpenCLI commands. This feature is activated when you type the `opencli` command, add a space, and then press `TAB`. The command suggestions are dynamically generated by the `opencli commands` script, which compiles a list of commands into the `/usr/local/opencli/commands.txt` file, utilized for the autocomplete suggestions.
